Descriptor for QPSKstr.mat

Modulation type: QPSK

Bit splitter:
Most  significant bit with cos() carrier
Least significant bit with sin() carrier

Constellation:
00 = -cos() -sin()
01 = -cos() +sin()
10 = +cos() -sin()
11 = +cos() +sin()

Modulation parameters:
Fs = 80000 Hz    (sampling frequency - samples/s)
Rb = 1000  bit/s (bit rate  [bits per second])
F0 = 4xRb  Hz    (carrier frequency)
Eb = 1     J     (bit average energy)
